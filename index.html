                    <br><strong>SO, WHO AM I?</strong></br>
                    <br>I'm a Full-Stack Engineer and Software Developer, skilled in HTML, CSS and Javascript integration. I am able to create engaging, professional, and functional web applications using best practice accessibility and the latest web standards guidelines, resulting in semantic and SEO friendly HTML and CSS. I am passionate about making sure that systems, interfaces, language and graphics are human-friendly, emotive, aesthetically pleasing, clear, on-brand and usable - with a touch of mellow smoothness. Iâ€™d love to work in a variety of environments, from Big Tech to tech startup companies. From workflow diagrams to detailed user interface mockups, I love shaping and crafting on-screen experiences.</br>
                    <br>Iâ€™ve always had a thing for aesthetics. At a very young age, I was fascinated with creating beautiful spaces and experiences for the enjoyment of others. Iâ€™m inspired by both timeless and whimsical designs both on and off screen that result in long-lasting effects for everyone involved. Iâ€™d consider myself a creative powerhouse, so infusing my witty personality with my clever string of ideas has allowed me to create amazing concepts for web applications and also while nurturing my knack for event planning and design. When Iâ€™m not coding and cultivating my developing skills, I enjoy spending time with my kid, movies, sketching, writing, off-roading in my Wrangler, working out, traveling, and occasionally karaoke. 
                    I believe that imagination can change the world, and my mission is to help businesses tap into their imaginations in an effort to build better and more creative and innovative web applications that connect them better with their customers and consumers. Doing what I love hinges on finding the right work relationships and as I strive to be the best at my craft, I am confidently capable within a wide range of tactical and big-picture web developing tasks. Letâ€™s create something great!</br>
