# Description

I was extremely excited to create my Developer portfolio because this will be the container in which all of my creativity in web application will be housed. Here, is the place where potential employers, as well as potential collaborators will be able to view my wide array of skills that will allow me to add value to future projects and to also build amazing working relationships and partnerships. During the creative process of my portfolio, l learned that attentiveness, uniqueness, precision and neatness are essential to a great developerâ€™s portfolio, and I am proud to be able to feel confident about my own.
